		    After the tragic massacre of the species of the menacing, but harmless, Gigantoids,
		    the Galactic Royal Fleet have all been charged with innumerous counts of homicide.
		    Shame on you. As punishment, you must now complete 10,000 hours of community service. 
		    Your first task will be cleaning up the galaxy by getting rid of the purple radioactive 
		    asteroids. Your task is complete all the asteroids are gone and light pollution is 
		    eradicated,resulting in the stars turning from purple back to blue. 
		    
		    W to move forwards, S to move back, A and D to turn, R to hyperspace
